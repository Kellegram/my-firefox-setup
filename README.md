# Kellegram's Firefox setup
These are my files and guides related to how I setup firefox  
  
My user.js is made using [Arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js).  
Please read their [wiki](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki) for a lot of useful information.  
My setup is designed with usability in mind, most ways of breaking sites were removed/modified. For privacy/less fingerprinting use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) or wait for my second user.js with more hardening.

## Adapting to your use

Coming soon
